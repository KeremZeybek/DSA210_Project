# DSA 210 Term Project: Did Goverments used the COVID-19 restrictions for political reasons

## Motivation and Overview
The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 triggered unprecedented government responses worldwide, including widespread lockdowns and social restrictions. This project aims to analyze the impact of these government-imposed restrictions on events of state repression against their own citizens.

Did governments use the public health crisis as an excuse or opportunity to suppress civil dissent or protests? This project aims to analyze the impact of government-imposed lockdowns and restrictions, implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic starting in 2020, on events of state repression against their own citizens.




## Data Sources
### Data from the ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project) will be mainly used to gather informations about repressions, political violence and demonstrations 
https://acleddata.com

**Data on Repression (12-month lag):** This is the primary dataset for the project. It contains data on state repression events worldwide from 2020 to 2024.

**Number of political violence events by country-month-year:** This dataset provides monthly data on political violence to support the analysis.

**Number of demonstration events by country-year:** This file provides annual data on demonstration events.

### Additional Data Sources ###
**OxCGRT (Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker):** This dataset provides the goverment responses and policies about the Covid-19 for every country from 2020 to June 2023.

## Data Analysis



## Tools and Technologies 
- **Python**: Main programming environment
- **Pandas:** Data preprocessing, merging, and transformation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization


## Possible Limitations
**Correlation vs. Causation:** This analysis, in its initial form, will primarily identify correlations between lockdown stringency and state repression. It cannot definitively prove causation. Other factors such as pre-existing political instability and economic stress could be influencing both.

**Definition of "Repression":** The project is dependent on ACLED's specific definition and data collection methodology for "repression events". This may not capture all forms of repression, such as digital surveillance or non-physical forms of intimidation.
